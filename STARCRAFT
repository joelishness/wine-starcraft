0. Quick Start

Compile 32-bit wine as normal (https://wiki.winehq.org/Building_Wine).

Install wine as normal. Install StarCraft using the installer from Blizzard.

StarCraft requires the Arial font. You should use winetricks corefonts to install it.

Also, using winecfg, you should set StarCraft.exe (or the default) to Windows XP. If you don't,
then you will get crash messages and Battle.net will fail to load.

Lastly, using winecfg, enable "Hide Wine version from applications". With the latest patch, this
option will also disable exports for some APIs that are too new for Windows XP. If you don't, then
under Windows XP mode StarCraft will crash after a couple minutes.
